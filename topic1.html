    <h2>The Birth of the World Wide Web</h2>

<p>
        The World Wide Web was invented by <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> in 1989 while working at CERN. 
        His goal was to create a system that allowed scientists to share and access documents easily over the internet.

    <h2>The Birth and Creation of the World Wide Web</h2>
    <p>
        The World Wide Web didn’t begin as a flashy global network or a bustling digital marketplace, it
        started as a simple idea from one curious mind. In 1989, British computer scientist 
        <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, working at CERN, recognized a problem: brilliant scientists 
        across the world had no easy way to share their research. Information existed, but it was trapped 
        in isolated systems, hidden behind incompatible software, and scattered like puzzle pieces with no 
        way to fit together. Berners-Lee envisioned a universal space where any document could connect to 
        another through clickable links, a so-called “web” of knowledge woven across the globe.
    </p>

    <p>
        With that spark of imagination of what COULD be, the World Wide Web was born.
    </p>

    <p>
        His idea became a revolutionary trio of technologies: <strong>URLs</strong> for addressing 
        information, <strong>HTTP</strong> for transferring it, and <strong>HTML</strong> for structuring 
        it. At first, the WWW was tiny—just one server and one website tucked inside CERN. But its potential 
        was enormous. When CERN made the Web free for everyone in 1993, it exploded beyond scientific walls, 
        quickly transforming from a simple research tool into the foundation of modern life. What began as 
        Berners-Lee’s elegant solution to information sharing evolved into a worldwide ecosystem where people 
        learn, shop, create, communicate, and build entire careers—all through a system originally crafted 
        to solve a single problem.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Web didn’t just connect computers. It connected people, ideas, and possibilities—redefining 
        what it means to live in a digital age.

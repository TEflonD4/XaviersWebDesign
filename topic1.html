    <h2>The Birth and Creation of the World Wide Web</h2>
    <p>
        The World Wide Web didn’t begin as a flashy global network or a bustling digital marketplace, it
        started as a simple idea from one curious mind. In 1989, British computer scientist 
        <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong>, working at CERN, recognized a problem: brilliant scientists 
        across the world had no easy way to share their research. Information existed, but it was trapped 
        in isolated systems, hidden behind incompatible software, and scattered like puzzle pieces with no 
        way to fit together. Berners-Lee envisioned a universal space where any document could connect to 
        another through clickable links, a so-called “web” of knowledge woven across the globe.
    </p>

    <p>
        With that spark of imagination of what COULD be, the World Wide Web was born.
    </p>

    <p>
       The <strong>World Wide Web</strong> was created in 1989 by British a computer scientist named <strong>Sir Tim Berners-Lee</strong> while he was working at CERN (W3C, n.d.) in Geneva, Switzerland. At that time, CERN had employed thousands of researchers from around the world who were using a plethora of incompatible computer systems. Files and data were scattered across machines, often requiring face-to-face contact or physical travel to get to. Berners-Lee recognized that this vast inefficiency was a hindrance to scientific progress. In his proposal, "Information Management: A Proposal” (CERN, 1989), he outlined a vision for an “information system” that would allow documents to be stored, retrieved, and linked seamlessly across different computers (Web Foundation, n.d.). His idea drew upon concepts of hypertext, a method of embedding links within documents so that users could move easily from one piece of information to another.
    </p>
            
    <p>
        To bring this vision into reality, Berners-Lee created three key things. First, was <strong>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</strong>, a simple but flexible way to encode documents with formatting and links. Next, was the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) (Web30, n.d.), a communication protocol that allowed clients, such as browsers, to request resources from servers. The third, was the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), a standardized system for identifying and accessing resources anywhere on the network (Wikipedia, 2023). Together, these elements formed the foundation of the Web. Berners-Lee also built the first browser, called WorldWideWeb, and the first web server, "info.cern.ch," which both ran on a NeXT computer at CERN. Although basic by many of today’s standards, these tools provided a foundational blueprint for how hyperlinked information could be navigated through a graphic interface.
    </p>
            
    <p>
        At first, the Web was a small-scale project within CERN, but it was soon widely released. In 1991, it became available to external institutions such as colleges which piqued the interest of the greater physics community (W3C, n.d.), and on April 30, 1993, CERN placed the software in the public domain, allowing anyone to use it without royalties or restrictions (CERN, n.d.). This decision proved pivotal. Because the technology was open and freely available, it spread quickly to universities, research institutions, and eventually the commercial sector. The release of graphic browsers like Mosaic in 1993 assisted in making the Web accessible to regular everyday users by allowing inline images and more intuitive navigation (Britannica, 2023). What began as a tool specifically and only for scientists would soon capture the imagination of billions worldwide.
    </p>

    <p>
        From its rather modest beginnings the Web evolved rapidly during the 1990s and early 2000s. The dot-com boom of the mid-1990s proved the commercial potential of the Web (Goldman Sachs, n.d.), with companies clashing to establish websites and capture market share. At the same time, governments and organizations recognized the importance of ensuring interoperability. In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to establish and maintain technical standards, such as those for HTML and <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong>, ensuring that the Web remained open and functional across platforms (Wikipedia, 2023)(Mozilla, n.d). The release of new versions of HTML, and later HTML5, enabled more complex and interactive content. By the early 2000s, the Web was no longer just a mere collection of ever unchanging pages but had become a platform for dynamic applications, giving rise to what was called “Web 2.0.” Social networking sites, streaming platforms, and interactive web applications reshaped the way people communicated, consumed media, and engaged with commerce (Investopedia, 2025).
    </p>
            
     <p>       
        Today, the Web is an integral part of daily life for billions of people. It is accessible on desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones, and it underpins essential activities from banking and education to entertainment and healthcare. It is useful to think of the Web as operating in different layers. The surface web consists of publicly available content that search engines index; the deep web contains information not indexed, such as databases and password-protected sites; and the dark web exists as a hidden layer of sites accessible only through special software (Britannica, 2023). Despite this complexity, the basic client-server model envisioned by Berners-Lee remains intact: a browser (the client) requests resources from servers, and those servers return content, whether text, images, or video. Standards such as HTML, HTTP, and URLs continue to govern how the Web functions, although modern security protocols like HTTPS have become critical to protecting data.
     </p>  

     <p>  
        The benefits of the Web are vast and undeniable. Firstly, it has made information accessible to an obscene amount of people. Scientific research, news, cultural materials, and educational resources can be discovered and used by anyone with an <strong>internet</strong> connection. This vast publication of knowledge has reshaped education and empowered individuals worldwide. Communication is another critical benefit. The Web supports real-time interactions through messaging and video conferencing as well as asynchronous tools like email, text, forums, and wikis. These modes of communication have fostered global collaboration in research, business, and activism. Economically, the Web has been foundational allowing businesses to reach global markets, while entire industries, such as online advertising and streaming, have emerged due to the Web’s infrastructure. Socially, it has lowered barriers to entry for publishing: blogs, video platforms, and social networks (such as YouTube, TikTok, Buzzfeed, etc.) allow individuals to share their voices and stories with potentially global audiences. On top of this, the Web has been a catalyst in the world of technological innovation, providing a platform for experimentation and interoperability, it has fueled the rise of cloud computing(such as AWS, mobile apps, and the Internet of Things (like smart home appliances). In short, it has fostered globalization, connected communities, and enabled greater efficiency in nearly every facet of modern life.
     </p>
            
      <p>  
        Yet alongside these benefits are many shortcomings. One of the most pressing concerns is privacy. The Web enables massive data collection by corporations and governments, often without users’ clear consent or understanding. This data is used for targeted advertising, surveillance, and profiling, raising ethical and legal issues (Business News Daily, 2023). Closely related are problems of security. The Web’s openness makes it vulnerable to attacks such as phishing, malware distribution, and ransomware, which exploit flaws in browsers and software. While <strong>HTTPS</strong> and improved browser security have mitigated some risks, breaches remain common.
      </p>
            
       <p>     
        Another critical shortcoming is the spread of misinformation and disinformation (Del Vicario, et.al, 2016). The Web’s low barrier to publication allows anyone to post content, which is both a strength and a weakness. False or misleading information can spread rapidly through blogs, social networks, or video platforms, sometimes with grave consequences for public health or democratic processes. Algorithmic amplification and echo chambers exacerbate the problem, creating environments where sensational or polarizing content is rewarded with attention.
      </p>
            
      <p>  
        The Web has also slowly been shifted away from the decentralized vision that Berners-Lee originally imagined. While the Web is technically decentralized, its practical use is dominated by a handful of powerful corporations. Companies such as Google, Meta (formerly Facebook), and Amazon have control over vast portions of the Web’s infrastructure and user attention. This has raised concerns about monopolistic practices, content moderation, censorship, and the concentration of economic and political power in this digital age. At the same time, the digital divide remains a blunt issue. While billions of people are online, many regions still lack reliable and affordable internet access. Even within connected regions, disparities in digital literacy and access to quality information persist (Britannica, 2023).
      </p>  
            
      <p>  
        The future of the Web will depend on addressing these challenges while maintaining its strengths. Some researchers and organizations are exploring decentralized web models, such as peer-to-peer networks and blockchain-based systems, that could reduce reliance on centralized corporate platforms. Content moderation and algorithmic transparency are being debated as ways to mitigate the harm caused by misinformation. Expanding access and digital literacy will be crucial for reducing inequities, while improving cybersecurity measures is necessary to protect users in an increasingly interconnected world. Questions of governance, whether through regulation, international agreements, or new forms of oversight, will continue to shape the World Wide Web’s journey.
      </p>  
            
      <p>  
        The Web began as a simple solution to a technical problem: scientists at CERN needed a better way to share documents. In solving that problem, Tim Berners-Lee and his collaborators created a system that would transform global communication, knowledge, and society. Today, the Web is indispensable, a backbone of modern life that brings immense benefits but also extreme risks. As societies continue to grapple with its impact, the balance between openness, security, equity, and governance will determine whether the Web realizes more of its original promise or becomes a tool that divides and manipulates the people as much as it connects and empowers them.

    <p>
        The Web didn’t just connect computers. It connected people, ideas, and possibilities—redefining 
        what it means to live in a digital age.

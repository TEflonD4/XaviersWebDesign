    <h2>The Evolution of HTML</h2>
    <p>
        HTML, or <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>, is the standard language used to create web pages.
        Over time, HTML has evolved to include new elements for structure, multimedia, and interactivity.
    </p>

<h3>Major HTML Versions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTML 1.0 (1993):</strong> The very first version, basic formatting only.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML 2.0 (1995):</strong> Standardized core features like forms and images.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML 4.01 (1999):</strong> Focused on separating content and style with CSS.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML5 (2014):</strong> Added video, audio, and semantic tags for modern web apps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>The History of HTML</h1>

    <p>
        HTML, which stands for <strong>HyperText Markup Language</strong>, is the standard
        language used to create webpages on the World Wide Web. It was originally
        developed by <strong>Tim Berners-Lee</strong> in the early 1990s as a simple way
        for researchers to share documents over the internet. Since then, HTML has gone
        through major changes and has become the foundation of nearly everything we see
        online today.
    </p>

    <h2>Early Beginnings (1991–1995)</h2>
    <p>
        The very first version of HTML was created in 1991. It only had 
        about 18 basic tags such as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, 
        <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> for links.
        There were no images, no styling, and no layout options. In 1993, 
        HTML began to grow when browsers like Mosaic added support for images, 
        making webpages more useful and visually interesting.
    </p>

    <h2>The Rise of Standardization</h2>
    <p>
        As the web became more popular, more companies started creating their own
        tags and extensions. This caused compatibility problems, so in 1994 
        the <strong>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</strong> was formed to standardize 
        HTML. This led to the release of official versions like HTML 2.0 (1995) 
        and HTML 3.2 (1997), which added tables, images, and improved formatting.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML 4.01 and the Growth of the Modern Web</h2>
    <p>
        In 1999, HTML 4.01 became the most stable and widely used version for many 
        years. It supported forms, scripts, improved tables, and laid the foundation 
        for interactive and dynamic websites. Around this time, CSS (Cascading Style 
        Sheets) became popular as a way to separate design from content, making 
        webpages easier to style and maintain.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML5 and the Future (2014–Present)</h2>
    <p>
        HTML5 was officially released in 2014 and brought major improvements that 
        made the modern web possible. It introduced built-in support for video, audio, 
        animations, and powerful APIs for web apps. HTML5 removed outdated tags and 
        encouraged cleaner, more accessible code. Today, HTML5 is the standard used 
        across all modern browsers and devices.
    </p>

    <h2>Why HTML Still Matters</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>It is the core structure of every website.</li>
        <li>It works together with CSS and JavaScript to create modern web applications.</li>
        <li>It continues to evolve as technology and user needs change.</li>
        <li>It supports accessibility and ensures sites work for everyone.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        From its humble beginnings as a simple document-sharing tool, HTML has grown into one 
        of the most important technologies in the world. Without it, the modern internet as we 
        know it would not exist.
